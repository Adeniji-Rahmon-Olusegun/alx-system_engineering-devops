# 0x08 Networking Basics Part 2

## General Overview
This repository contains information and resources related to Networking Basics Part 1. It covers fundamental concepts including `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `etc/hosts`, and displaying active network interfaces on your machine.

## Topics Covered
- **localhost/127.0.0.1**: Understand the concept of `localhost`, which refers to the local computer or the computer you are currently working on. `127.0.0.1` is the loopback IP address assigned to the localhost, allowing a computer to send packets to itself.

- **0.0.0.0**: Explore the meaning of `0.0.0.0`, which is a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target. It typically indicates that a network interface is not associated with any specific IP address.

- **/etc/hosts**: Learn about the `/etc/hosts` file, which is a local operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is used to supplement or replace the domain name resolution provided by Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

- **Displaying Active Network Interfaces**: Discover methods to display the active network interfaces on your machine, providing insight into the network connections available and their configurations.
