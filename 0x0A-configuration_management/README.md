## 0x0A: Configuration Management using Puppet

This repository provides an introduction to configuration management with Puppet. 

**What is Puppet?**

Puppet is an open-source tool for automating the configuration of servers and other systems. It allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure and enforce that state across all managed nodes. This ensures consistency, reduces manual errors, and simplifies system administration.

**What's in this repository?**

This repository includes:

* **Puppet manifests:** These files define the desired state of your systems using Puppet's declarative language. 
* **Modules (optional):** You might have reusable configurations separated into modules for better organization.
* **README (this file):** Provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

**Getting Started**

To use this repository, you'll need a basic understanding of Linux and familiarity with command line tools. Here's a general guide:

1. **Install Puppet:** Follow the official documentation to install Puppet on your server: [https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/install_puppet.html](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/install_puppet.html)
