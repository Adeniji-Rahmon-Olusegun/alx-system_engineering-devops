# 0x0F: Load Balancer

This README describes a potential implementation of a simple load balancer using the `nginx` web server. 

A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving overall performance, reliability, and scalability.

**Functionality**

This example demonstrates how to configure `nginx` to act as a load balancer, directing requests to backend servers. Here's a breakdown of the typical setup:

1. **Frontend:** Nginx receives incoming requests from clients.
2. **Backend Servers:** These are the actual servers hosting the applications or resources being accessed.
3. **Load Balancing Algorithm:** Nginx implements a specific algorithm (e.g., round robin, least connections) to distribute requests among the backend servers.

**Configuration Example**

This is a basic example using a round-robin strategy. The actual configuration may vary based on your specific needs:

```nginx
http {
  # Define the frontend server block
  server {
    listen 80;  # Listen on port 80 (default HTTP port)

    # Backend server definitions
    upstream backend {
      server server1.example.com:8080;  # First backend server
      server server2.example.com:8080;  # Second backend server
    }

    # Route requests to the backend server group
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend/;  # Forward requests to upstream backend
      proxy_set_header Host $host;  # Preserve the original hostname
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `server` block defines the frontend configuration.
- The `upstream` block defines a group of backend servers.
- The `location` block specifies how requests are routed.
  - `proxy_pass` directs requests to the `backend` group.
  - `proxy_set_header Host` ensures the original hostname is sent to the backend server.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Explore different algorithms offered by `nginx` (e.g., least connections, weighted round robin) to optimize for your specific scenario.
- **Health Checks:** Implement health checks to monitor the availability and performance of backend servers. Nginx can remove unhealthy servers from the pool temporarily.
- **Security:** Secure your load balancer configuration with appropriate access control and authentication mechanisms.
