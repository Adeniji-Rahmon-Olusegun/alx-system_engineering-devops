## Introduction
Application Server is a robust, scalable, and high-performance server designed to handle web requests, manage application logic, and interact with databases. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as the backbone for various web and mobile applications, providing essential services such as authentication, data processing, and real-time communication.

## Features
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to handle growing traffic.
- **Security**: Implements best practices for secure communications.
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture to add or modify features easily.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a set of RESTful endpoints for interaction.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB
- **Other Dependencies**: Listed in `package.json`

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/application-server.git
    cd application-server
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

## Configuration
Configuration options can be found and modified in the `config` directory. Key configurations include:

- **Database Config**: `config/database.js`
- **Server Config**: `config/server.js`

## Usage
1. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. **Access the server**:
    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints
The Application Server exposes several API endpoints for different functionalities. Below are some key endpoints:

- **Authentication**:
    - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
    - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- **User Management**:
    - `GET /api/users` - Get all users
    - `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- **Data Management**:
    - `GET /api/data` - Fetch data
    - `POST /api/data` - Submit data

For a detailed list of all endpoints, refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md).

## Deployment
To deploy the application server, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Deploy to a cloud provider** (e.g., AWS, Heroku):
    Follow the provider-specific instructions for deploying Node.js applications.

## Testing
To run tests, use the following commands:

1. **Run unit tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

2. **Run integration tests**:
    ```bash
    npm run test:integration
    ```
